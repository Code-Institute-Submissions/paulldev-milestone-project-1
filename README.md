## Introduction
Speak Norwegian is a website designed for people who want to learn norwegian as quickly as possible. You will learn the most commonly used words first, because these are the words that people use most frequently on a daily basis.
Did you know that learning the most frequently used 2000 words of a language will allow you to understand approximately 75% of most conversations?
This website will give the english word, the norwegian translation, an example sentence to give context, and an audio file for pronounciation.
A lot of traditional language courses will teach you by subject (shopping, clothes, etc). This method will delay your progress because it will take longer for you to be able to talk with native norwegian speakers, unless the want to talk about shopping and clothes! The sooner you can start practicing with native speakers, the quicker you will learn.
